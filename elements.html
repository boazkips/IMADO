			<br><p class="sample-text">
				 
				But many of the articles published last month failed to put the numbers of teen 
				pregnancies into context. In Kenya, high-risk early pregnancy has long been a societal 
				challenge. Government demographic data from 2014, the latest available, show that 15 percent of 
				girls aged 15-19 had already given birth, and another three percent were pregnant with their 
				first child – the highest rates in East Africa.
				Underpinning any COVID-19-related rise in teen pregnancies are other significant challenges, 
				including insufficient funding for reproductive health services and a lack of comprehensive sex 
				education in schools – which have contributed to Kenya’s alarming numbers.

			<h3 class="text-heading">COVID-19 makes it worse, Ashley Akoth*</h3>
			<p class="sample-text">
				Comprehensive national data on the impact of COVID-19 on teen pregnancy 
				rates are not yet available. At least anecdotally, though, some healthcare 
				providers suspect a coronavirus effect. 

			</p>
			<br><p class="sample-text">
				Last September, Ashley Okoth*, a high school student living in a remote 
				village in western Kenya, boarded a public bus to travel to the nearest 
				city to visit her aunt. She sat next to an older man, who seemed friendly 
				and started chatting with her. By the end of the ride, Okoth had taken his 
				number, and the two began texting. 
				Okoth was an eager student, who enjoyed physics, math, and geography and 
				loved playing baseball and handball with her friends. She planned to attend 
				university to become a teacher. So Okoth was devastated when COVID-19 closed 
				her school in mid-March, and her days blurred into a mundane routine of doing 
				chores and helping her mother at her job as a sand harvester. 
			</p></br>

			<br><p class="sample-text">
			With time on her hands, Okoth decided to visit the man from the bus, and they had sex. 
			Just weeks later, Okoth realised she was pregnant. She says her father will prevent her 
			from returning to school — a punishment for her pregnancy.
			</p></br> 

			<br><p class="sample-text">
			“I wish I had been going to school, because if I had been [occupied] going to school, 
			this would have not happened,” Okoth told The New Humanitarian. “I feel bad because my 
			dream has failed now just because of my pregnancy.”
			</p></br> 

			<br><p class="sample-text">
			“I feel bad because my dream has failed now just because of my pregnancy.”
			</p></br>

			<br><p class="sample-text">
			Okoth is not alone.
			</p></br>

            <h3 class="text-heading">Lack of sex education </h3>

			<br><p class="sample-text">
			In 2013, the Kenyan government committed to scaling up sex education, 
			beginning courses in primary schools. But efforts to make good on this 
			promise have been met with fierce opposition from conservative and religious 
			groups. 
			</p></br>

			<br><p class="sample-text">
			Currently, when sex education is taught at all, 
			courses focus largely on HIV prevention and 
			abstinence — which means students’ knowledge of 
			reproductive and sexual health is often limited. 
			</p></br>

			<br><p class="sample-text">
			“Parents told us, ‘Those things are taught in school. 
			We do not talk to our children about sex. That is a taboo. 
			So we expect that the teachers should tell our children about 
			sex and about how to protect themselves,’” said Mercy Chege, 
			director of programmes at Plan International, an NGO advocating 
			for children’s rights and girls’ equality. 
			</p></br>

            <br><p class="sample-text">
			She continued: “The teachers say, ‘It is the work of the 
			parents to teach their children about sex’... So now you’ll 
			find that the children will go back to the internet, they’ll 
			go back to their friends and they’ll try to discover.” 
			</p></br>

			<br><p class="sample-text">
			It’s a situation familiar to Okoth, the high school student 
			who is now pregnant. She said she learned the basics of human 
			reproduction in school, but she never received a thorough sexual health education.
			</p></br>

			<br><p class="sample-text">
			Kenya’s parliament is currently debating legislation mandating 
			age-appropriate sex education in schools.
			</p></br>

            <br><p class="sample-text">
			But religious leaders and cultural conservatives have 
			launched an aggressive campaign against the bill, arguing 
			that such a curriculum runs counter to Kenyan cultural values. 
			They’ve taken to the airwaves and social media platforms to encourage a 
			public backlash against the bill.
